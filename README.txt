based-connect
=============

If you own a Bose device, you'll know that Bose Connect is not available on
Linux. This program attempts to reverse engineer that app in order to give the
device Linux support.

Building
--------

Simply run `make -j` to build the program. The executable produced will be
called `based-connect`.

Installing
----------

Run `make install` to install the program. The `PREFIX` and `DESTDIR` variables
are assignable and have the traditional meaning.

Alternatively, if you run Arch Linux, you can download it from the AUR here:

https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/based-connect-git/

Dependencies
------------

* BlueZ
	* bluez-libs on Arch Linux
	* libbluetooth-dev on Debian and Ubuntu

Disclaimer
----------

This has only been tested on Bose QuietComfort 35's with firmware 1.3.2, 1.2.9,
1.06 and SoundLink II's with firmware 2.1.1. I cannot ensure that this program
works on any other devices.

Todo
----

* Implement "getters" for current headphone state
	* Current status of all setters currently implemented
	* Date of manufacturing
* Get/set volume
* Port to MacOS (and maybe Windows)
* Firmware updates?

Firmware Details
----------------

See details.txt for partly reverse engineered but unimplemented (and unknown)
details.
